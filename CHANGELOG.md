# Changelog

All notable changes to Audiohoard are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Rebuilt catalog artist pages with artwork hero headers, identity chips, grouped discography cards, filter chips, compact monitor controls, and native form actions.
- Added catalog album duplicate reconciliation for legacy punctuation-normalization collisions.

### Changed
- Cached PBKDF2-derived Fernet settings keys per process, removing repeated 200,000-iteration derivation from request-time secret decrypts.
- Regenerated favicons with border-connected background keying to transparent alpha while keeping launcher icons opaque.
- Enrichment fills missing artist artwork from Deezer, backfills album track counts from providers without overwriting opened tracklists, and schedules first-open background enrichment.

### Fixed
- Scoped global form-control CSS so checkboxes and radios no longer render as full-width 42px controls.
- Normalized Unicode apostrophes, quotes, and dashes during album matching so curly/straight punctuation variants dedupe correctly.
